1. Java Packages: All the Java files share the same package structure "com.ecommerce". This is a common practice in Java to organize related classes and interfaces.

2. Spring Boot Framework: The Application.java file indicates that the project is using Spring Boot. This is shared across all the Java files as they will use annotations and classes provided by Spring Boot.

3. Model Classes: Product.java, User.java, and Order.java are model classes that represent the data in the application. These classes are shared across the controller, service, and repository layers.

4. Repository Interfaces: ProductRepository.java, UserRepository.java, and OrderRepository.java are interfaces for performing database operations. These are shared by the service layer.

5. Service Classes: ProductService.java, UserService.java, and OrderService.java are service classes that contain business logic. These are shared by the controller layer.

6. Controller Classes: ProductController.java, UserController.java, and OrderController.java are controller classes that handle HTTP requests. They share the service classes.

7. Application Properties: The application.properties file is shared across the application for configuration settings.

8. HTML Templates: index.html, product.html, user.html, and order.html are shared by the controller layer to render views.

9. Static Resources: main.css and main.js are shared across all the HTML templates for styling and functionality.

10. Test Classes: ApplicationTests.java, ProductControllerTests.java, UserControllerTests.java, OrderControllerTests.java, ProductServiceTests.java, UserServiceTests.java, and OrderServiceTests.java share the classes they are testing.

11. Maven: The pom.xml file indicates that the project is using Maven. This is shared across the project for dependency management and build process.

12. DOM Elements: The id names of DOM elements in the HTML templates are shared with the main.js file for manipulation and event handling.

13. Message Names: Any message names used for internationalization or error handling would be shared across the application.

14. Function Names: Function names in the service classes are shared with the controller classes. Similarly, function names in the repository interfaces are shared with the service classes. In the main.js file, function names are shared with the event handlers.
